Description: This Script uses the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) over
USB at the moment to take an initial Screenshot(Screen Capture) and then
requires the user to press the "Enter" key to continue with the screenshot
process. This is the initial release, very simple code for the time being.<br />

The format of the files generated utilize the date and time of the screenshot
being taken in the following format, date followed by time:
MM-DD-YYYY-HH-MM-SS.SS.PNG
where initial MM = Month, DD = Day, YYYY = Year, HH = Hour (24H Format),
Second MM = Minutes, SS.SS = Second (including Partial Seconds).
The script will first use ADB to create a directory called
"InfiniCapADB" at the root of the SD card and then proceed to take the initial
screenshot. ADB errors that arise shall be output to the screen.<br />
